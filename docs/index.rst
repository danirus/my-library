my-library
##########

**my-library** is a ficticious project with the sole purpose of showing how to build and serve multiple versions of the documentation. The documentation is made of one single page. This one. And now it is time for the admonition that includes a mention to the current version number, and a list of the previous versions.

.. note::

   This documentation represents the current version, v1.0.0, of my-library.
